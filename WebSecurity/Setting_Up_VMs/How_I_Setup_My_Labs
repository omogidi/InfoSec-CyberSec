Step 1.
I installed the following VMware. I will not be providing the VM files itself but can share the website where I downloaded them from

kali-linux-2025
Windows10 Operating System
Windows Server 2016
Ubuntu Web Server
Metaspolitable-2

....Add Image her for Downloaded File

Step 2
As a security aware individual, always confirm checksum with the software vendor
I ran the command below on my cmd to confirm checksum for the VMs

Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA1 –Path ".\C:\*.*"
......Add Image......

See Checksum file from the vendor
metasploitable-linux-2.0.0.zip 3BD77207F74B7031E50F7CD83539BD401B1284FF
ubuntu-18.04-live-server-amd64.iso 0B3490DE9839C3918E35F01AA8A05C9AE286FC94
Win10.7z 481378AF6CE94A16CBED1D70C49BD9E00AF1E5B2
win2016x64.7z 18608362F51FDC9A20F70534A8F0108BDD1CDDD4

Step 3
Now I needed to start setting up the VM. I started with Kali.
I opened it up on the VMware workstation, entered the credentials.
I ran apt-get-update and apt-get-upgrade to update the VM

I changed the hostname
nano /etc/hostname and replaced kali with my username.

I updated the host file to prevent some potential issues with name resolution
nano /etc/hosts 

Added 
127.0.0.1  username
127.0.0.1 username-kali

Now added the entry for the webservers I will be buliding.
10.0.0.200  ubuntuwebserver
10.0.0.201  windowserver
10.0.0.202  windows10

Step4
Creating LAN Segment
On VMware, I created a Lan Segment by clicking on VM >> Settings >> Add New Network Adapter
Slect LAN Segment, named it and modified it to use static IP address

Next I modified the /etc/network/interfaces file and added the IP information for the newly created network adapter eth1
address 10.0.0.99
netmask 255.255.255.0

Saved the file and exit. Reboot

Preparing My Windows 10
Extracted the VM and loaded it to the VMWare workstation
Changed the network adapter to the LAN Segment created earlier.
Modified the disk space
Power on the Windows 10 VM
Changed computer name
Disable firewall
Assign Ip statically
IP Address: 10.0.0.100
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

Ping your Kali Linux from cmd

Preparing My Windows server 2016
Extracted the VM and loaded it to the VMWare workstation
Changed the network adapter to the LAN Segment created earlier.
Modified the disk space
Power on the Windows 10 VM
Changed computer name
Disable firewall
Assign Ip statically
IP Address: 10.0.0.201
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Ping the windows server from Kali linux

....Add Image...



Setup Metasploitable server
Extracted the VM and loaded it to the VMWare workstation
Changed the network adapter to the LAN Segment created earlier.
Login with the username and password
Changed the hostname
modified the Network Interfaces
nano /etc/network/interfaces
address 10.0.0.202
▪ netmask 255.255.255.0 
▪ network 10.0.0.0 
▪ broadcast 10.0.0.255

Reboot the VM
ping the metasploitable server from Kali


Setup Ubuntu web server
Loaded the webserver, configured and installed it
After installation. Changed the hostname
Add another network adapter to the VM
Reboot the VM
Moved into the /etc/netplan directory and issue ls -all command
there is a file called with the yaml file copy the file and renamed the new file
Used a text editor to modify the new file

....Add image....

Saved file and exit
Apploed changes
Sudo netplan apply

Installing Mutillidae on the Ubuntu server

Select America and Toronto as your location
sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
▪ Update the date and time on your Ubuntu Server
sudo date -s "$(wget -qSO- --max-redirect=0 google.com 2>&1 | grep Date: | cut -d' ' -f5-8)Z"
▪ Restart the VM:
sudo shutdown –r now
▪ Once the VM comes back up, login with your FOLusername and password of Ubuntu1
▪ Update your repository list
sudo apt-get update

Update your hosts file to include your FOLusername-uws in the list. See example below:
sudo nano /etc/hosts

Install Apache Server
sudo apt-get install apache2 apache2-utils
▪ Install the MYSQL server:
sudo apt-get install mysql-server
▪ Configure the MYSQL installation to work with Mutillidae:
sudo mysql –u root
use mysql;
update user set authentication_string=PASSWORD('') where user='root';
update user set plugin='mysql_native_password' where user='root';
flush privileges;
quit;
▪ Restart MySQL:
sudo service mysql restart
▪ Install unzip
apt-get install unzip
▪ Download a Mutillidae installation script to your /var/www/ directory by using the following:
cd /var/www
sudo wget http://transpirenetworks.com/mutillidae_setup.sh
(As an alternative, mutillidae_setup.7z is also available with a password of info6076)

Execute the Mutillidae installation script:
sudo bash mutillidae_setup.sh
▪ Unzip the LATEST-mutillidae-2.6.62.zip file
sudo unzip LATEST-mutillidae-2.6.62.zip

Open the web browser in Kali and navigate to folusername-uws/mutillidae
▪ You may need to click on setup/reset database
▪ If you have done everything correctly, your results should look like the example below:
