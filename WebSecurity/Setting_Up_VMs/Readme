In this Repository. I documented how I set up VMs that I will be using in web security. I also connected them to each other and pinging to make sure they are connected

The following VMs were used
VMWare workstation
Kali-Linux-2025
Window10 operating System
Windows Server 2016
Ubuntu Web Server
Metaspoitable2-linux

Installed the VMWare workstation from the Vmware website

I downloaded all the files in a folder.
